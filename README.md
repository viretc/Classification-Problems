# Classification Problems

Several competitions and classification problems solved using machine learning.

## Pump it up: data mining the water table
Multiclass (3) classification problem – high-dimensional data set, which required some dimensionally reduction techniques and features engineering.

**Best Final score 82.55% - Top 1% as of March 2018.**

Thank you to my classmate Alexandre Olivier for the support during this competition.

## Kaggle: Titanic: Machine Learning form Disaster
Binary classification problem - Handy data set, with reasonably amounts of features and “low dimensionality”

**Best Final score 79.8% - Top 12% as of April 2018.**

The goal for the competition was not so much the accuracy but more to implement some genetic programming techniques (gplearn) for features creation and to run some of the algorithm into H20.
